  								      <p class="titleBlue">More about Marlies</p>
								      <p class="titleBlue">&nbsp;</p>
								      <p class="bodytext">Her creativity gently lifts and guides the message. She's a master at matching the right image to the copy for the 
								        desired impact. Sometimes, it's a clear link. At other times, it's clever and infused, befitting a more sophisticated audience.</p>
								      <p>&nbsp;</p>
								      <p>Inspired by nature and sunsets, Marlies brings a vividly fresh approach to graphic design. She's an avid fan of the silly 
								        yet sincere writing of Dr. Seuss (yes, she's also a mom) and is delighted by his book, &quot;Oh, the places you'll go.&quot; 
								        With a &ldquo;glass is half full&rdquo; attitude, she abides by the motto: &quot;Do something everyday that makes you happy.&quot;</p>
								      <p>&nbsp;</p>

								      <p class="titleBlue">&nbsp;</p>
								      <p>"When I start to design a project, my first thoughts are, &rsquo;What am I going to pick-up and look at? What is going to 
								        catch my eye in a mass of media and product?&rsquo; Once I've answered those questions, I'm ready to go for it. I'm confident 
								        about my design.&rdquo;</p>
								      <p>&nbsp;</p>
								      <p>With a BFA from Eastern Michigan University and a minor in Art History, she knows theory and 
								        application. She has a deep appreciation for the cultural impact of art, and uses graphic design to create a lasting 
								        impression for clients. She has 28 years of experience as a graphic designer: in a corporate setting, at an ad agency and 
								        as an associate of Cezat Creative Resources.</p>
