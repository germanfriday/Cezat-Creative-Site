								      <p class="titleBlue">&nbsp;</p>
								      <p><b><span class="titleGreen">Health Care Marketing</span></b> <a name="healthcaremarketing"></a></p>
								      <p class="bodytext">While on staff at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Liz learned
								        the language of medicine. This in-depth
								        experience enables her to translate the
								        complex and technical concepts of medical
								        and scientific research into readable reports, proposals and
								        articles that can be understood by non-technical audiences. With
								        this expertise, she has served as a consultant and writer for
								        health care groups in Michigan, Ohio, California and other states. </p>
								      <p>&nbsp;</p>
								      <p class="bodytext">Health care philanthropy is another area of focus. Liz has written
								        dozens of case statements, grant proposals and brochures to inform
								        and influence donors and grant-makers about nonprofit programs,
								        services and capital campaigns.</p>
								      <p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
								      <p class="bodytext"><b><span class="titleGreen">Publications </span></b><a name="publications"></a></p>
								      <p class="bodytext">The editorial excellence of <em>Cezat Creative
								          Resources</em> is clearly demonstrated in our publications
								          experience. Since her early start producing
								          an award-winning publication for referring
								          physicians, Liz has developed and served as editor of six publications
								          at different health care organizations
								        and senior centers. When asked: &ldquo;How did you hear about
								        us?,&rdquo; customers
								          at one health care organization consistently
								          mentioned a newsletter produced by <em>Cezat Creative Resources</em> as
								          one of the top five items.</p>
								      <p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
								      <p class="bodytext">Liz has a B.A. from Wayne State University (Radio, TV &amp; Film) with a minor in journalism. </p>
